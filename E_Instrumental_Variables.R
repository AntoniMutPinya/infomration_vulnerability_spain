# These instruments are constructed based on specific variables from the ecf_2016 dataset, 
# including binary indicators and direct assignments. These IVs will help address endogeneity or omitted variable biases in the regressions. 
# Each instrument is based on conditional logic or directly sourced from the dataset to form relevant control variables for the models.
